This project will not add coins or tokens listed below.    
Includes similar ones too. (like Monaparty)

# `ETH` tokens
For ETH tokens, they use ETH address for transferring.   
Also, deployed contract have an address generated from owner address.    
If you wish to store tokens safely, please use [ETH](https://nao20010128nao.github.io/WalletGenerator.net/?currency=Ethereum) instead.

# `NEM` mosaics
For NEM mosaics, they use NEM address for transferring.    
If you wish to store mosaics safely, please use [NEM](https://nao20010128nao.github.io/WalletGenerator.net/?currency=NEM) instead.

# Counterparty tokens
For Counterparty, they use BTC address for transferring.   
If you wish to store tokens safely, please use [BTC](https://nao20010128nao.github.io/WalletGenerator.net/?currency=Bitcoin) instead.    
Note that you can't use SegWit addresses for Counterparty.

# `Bitcoin SV (Satoshi's Vision)` and `Bitcoin Cash ABC`
Because they are forked from Bitcoin Cash, please use [BCH](https://nao20010128nao.github.io/WalletGenerator.net/?currency=BitcoinCash) for now.    
When they added new form of address, I'll split them.

# `CPUchain`
![reason](https://archive.is/BjLbz/1187fcd0eb9915e882c762c58ddc6bc8d6c7c4b8.jpg)     
See #14 or [archive](http://archive.is/wZQxy).

# Coins already added
There is no meaning to add coin that is already available.    
Use ones already existing.
